A simple example using the Pico-Ice board

This example shows how to use icemulti to create firmware with up to four images.
Each of the four images blinks another LED: Blue, Green, Red, B+G+R 
Each image blinks 7 times, the dynamically boots to the next image.
The four images continuously rotate in this manner.
